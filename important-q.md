# Interview Question:

- Find All Anagrams in a String [Amazon]

- [Google] 

    I’m excited to share my Google L4 interview experience, including the timeline and the mixed emotions I felt throughout the process.

    Phone Screening [12-08-2024]:
    I was given a formula with letters and parentheses and asked to remove all parentheses from the formula.

    Outcome: After 10 days, my recruiter informed me that the phone screening went well, and they would schedule the next round of interviews.

    The Waiting Game:
    After that, there was complete silence for a month. No emails, no calls, nothing. I honestly started feeling like they had put a hold on my application or frozen the hiring process.

    Then, in the last week of September, I finally got a call and was informed that my next rounds were scheduled.

    Interview Rounds:
    Round 1 [08-10-2024]:
    Graph problem involving a modified DFS approach. I messed up the first part of the code and ended up spending the entire time debugging it. As a result, I didn’t have enough time to tackle the follow-up questions. It was a bit disappointing, but I pushed forward and didn’t let it derail my confidence.

    Round 2 [09-10-2024]:
    This round involved a job submission and completion problem. The first question was a standard LeetCode medium-level problem, and the follow-up added an extra layer of prioritization, which made it more complex, almost like a medium/hard level problem. I solved the first question correctly with a clean code and dry run using a test case. For the second question, I didn’t finish the entire solution due to time constraints. I skipped a few minor parts of the code, as suggested by the interviewer, to focus on the main logic.

    Round 3 [10-10-2024]:
    This round was similar (Not exactly same) to Meeting Rooms II and Meeting Rooms III — focused on handling meeting room allocation with added constraints. The first question was a medium-level LeetCode problem, while the follow-up was more challenging, bordering on medium/hard. I managed to solve both questions within 35 minutes, leaving us with extra time. We used that time to discuss alternative approaches and data structures, along with their pros and cons. This felt like a great opportunity to showcase my problem-solving approach and technical depth.

    Round 4 [11-10-2024]: Googleyness
    Behavioral interview with typical questions about my experience, teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution.

    After completing the fourth round, I received the feedback:

    Round 1: Lean hire
    Round 2: Hire
    Round 3: Hire
    Round 4 (Googleyness): Hire
    Team Matching [15-10-2024]:
    The first 10 minutes of the team matching interview were spent discussing my interests and experience. The next 10 minutes focused on explaining the team’s work. In the final 5-10 minutes, I had the opportunity to ask the hiring manager any questions.

    I received confirmation from my recruiter within 15 minutes that I matched with the team. They asked for my decision, and I said yes.

    The next day, my recruiter reached out for basic information. After that, there was another period of silence. I had no idea what was going on.

    The Long Wait:
    After 12 days, I received a message saying that the Hiring Committee (HC) had approved my packet. We discussed salary, and the following day I received the offer letter, which I happily accepted.

    Final Thoughts:
    If you’re feeling stuck or discouraged during your interview process, remember that the journey can be long and unpredictable. There will be moments of silence, uncertainty, and doubt. But persistence, patience, and staying motivated will pay off in the end. Keep going, and don’t lose hope!
